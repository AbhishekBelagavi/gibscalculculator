Relationship Between Gibbs Free Energy and EMF of a Cell
In the case of galvanic cells, Gibbs energy change ΔG is related to the electrical work done by the cell.

ΔG = -nFE(cell)

Where, n = no. of moles of electrons involved

F = the Faraday constant

E = emf of the cell

F=1 Faraday =96500 coulomb
